            <p>Guru Ji was a well-versed scholar of many languages like Urdu, Hindi, Sanksrit, Persian, Braj Bhasha and Gurmukhi (script). His divine poetic compositions are all of phenomenal literary level. Guru Ji composed Jaap Sahib, when he was just
              19 years old. Jaap Sahib describes the attributes of the Almighty in an ultimate rhythmic style. The vocabulary and connotations used are not restrictive, rather the message delivered stresses on universal-ism, and a person from any background/faith
              can relate to it. Through his literary writings, Guru Ji preached his message of oneness , love , equality and moral code of conduct (like the former Gurus). The 'Baichitar Natak', a great literary work of Guru Ji, includes description of
              several events from the Guru's life. Guru Ji was also well-versed in the art of music. In fact, he invented beautiful instruments like "Taus" and "Dilruba". Guru Jee was adept at the usage of weapons and archery. He owned the most sophisticated
              and exceptional weapons of those times. These are still present in Hazur Sahib, Nanded. One of his weapons, a very unique javelin, called 'Nagini Barcha', was used by Bhai Bachittar Singh, to kill the drunken mad elephant which was sent
              by the Mughal forces to attack the Sikhs, when they were in the fort of Chamkaur. Guru Ji fought many battles, but his intention behind fighting battles was never political, ie., he did not fight to own a land or to increase his territory,
              like other kings did. He never initiated any attack. All the battle fought by him were the result of the attack by unjust people misusing their power. His main purpose was to preach his divine message, so fighting for materialistic gains
              was of no interest to him. But yes, he did fight against tyranny, oppression and injustice. He preaches the same in his bani (words), that one must pick up the sword , only when all other efforts of curbing oppression have failed. Guru Gobind
              Singh Jee cherished art. It is said that there were 52 celebrated poets in the Guru's darbar (court).</p>
