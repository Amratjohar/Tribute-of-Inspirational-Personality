          <h3>December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            The Mughal army along with the armies of Hill Rajas had laid a siege
            on Anandpur Sahib Fort since 3 May 1704. All the supplies coming to
            the fort were cut off, and the seven month long siege had depleted
            all the resources inside the fort, and there was nothing left in the
            fort to eat. In addition, hunger, thirst, scarcity of supplies,
            restriction on movements had taken their toll as well, yet Guru Ji
            was in a firm and high spirits. It was the hardship and the hopeless
            situation that made the forty Sikhs sign the "Disclaimer" that we
            are not Sikhs and walk out of the fort, unharmed by the forces that
            laid the siege.

          <p>
            Although, Guru Ji was being pressured by the exhausted Sikhs to take
            on the promise of safe passage and evacuate from the fort, but Guru
            Ji said that enemy's intentions were not sincere and they could not
            be trusted. Finally, at the behest of famished Sikhs and mother of
            Guru Ji Mata Gujri Ji it was agreed that the fort will be evacuated,
            although Guru Ji was still not in favor. On this fateful night of 20
            December the fort was evacuated at night. The mid-winter night was
            dark and bitterly cold, and now on top of that it began to rain
            heavily. The unfavorable weather and the flooded River Sirsa in full
            spate, did make the task of evacuation formidable. Now, on top of
            this forces that had laid the siege forgetting their promises of
            safe passage, pounded on the Sikhs and very heavy fighting took
            place.

          <h3>21 December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            It was early morning now. Most of the fighting had died, still the
            bullets, arrows were flying and rain was falling but Guru Ji did not
            deviate from the daily morning ceremony of singing of bani. After
            the prayers were offered and Guru Ji asked to prepare for crossing
            the River Sirsa. Guru Ji had just crossed the swollen river and
            other Sikhs were in the midst of crossing the river, when a
            contingent of the Mughal army arrived. The commander of Guru Ji's
            forces who was guarding the rear end of the column, single-handed
            resisted the chasing Mughal army, so that others could cross the
            swollen river. Many sikhs gave their life but held the advancing
            forces for long time to allow remaining Sikhs and two eldest
            Sahibzade to cross the river.

          <p>
            It is here only that that Mata Gujri Ji, the aged mother of Guru
            Gobind Singh with her two little grandsons got separated from the
            main party and escaped in one direction. They kept moving so that
            they could escape from the harm's way and by chance they met Gangu
            who was cook in Guru Ji's household. He took them to his village
            Kheri promising shelter but in the morning turned them over to the
            officials of Nawab of Sirhind. Guru Gobind Singh Ji accompanied by
            his two older sons and a group of forty survivors marched towards
            Ropar. There the village people refused to offer shelter for fear
            retribution and directed them to a brick kiln. There Guru Ji decided
            to camp for the night. However, a landlord farmer Chaudhri Budhe
            Chand of Chamkaur offered his haveli (type of house in a shape of
            fortess) to Guru Ji as that will provide some shelter, cover and
            protection against the chasing armies. By night time the marauding
            Imperial forces also reached Chamkaur and had surrounded this mud
            house designed like a fort.

          <h3>22 December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            Next day, early morning of 22 December the Imperial army of hundred
            thousand against 45 sikhs attacked with the aim of capturing the
            fortress and Guru Ji. There, Guru Ji assigned eight of his Sikh
            soldiers each in a party of two to guard the entrance and the four
            walls. Guru Ji situated himself on the upper floor and from there
            not strategically directed his Sikh soldiers but also kept an
            incessant shower of arrows. Thus from the vantage position Guru Ji
            not only commandeered the fight but also with his arrows
            complemented the ground forces resisting the advancing armies. The
            general of the Mughal army Nahar Khan and Ghairat Khan tried to
            scale the wall with the help of a ladder but were shot down in
            timely manner by Guru Ji with an arrow. The death of the leader
            quite demoralized the attacking forces. Now, Nawab of Sirhind took
            the lead and asked his forces to make the final charge. Both the
            elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and three of five Panj Pyares,
            and around thirty of the Sikhs gave their lives there defending the
            haveli.

          <h3>22 December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            Only five Sikhs were left to defend the place. They persuaded Guru
            Ji to retreat and save himself in the larger interest of the nation,
            so that Guru Ji can still carry on the mission and create new bands
            of Khalsa. This was done by the remaining five Sikhs in form of a
            "Gurmatta" (a unanimous resolution) and Guru Ji bowed to the mandate
            of the supreme authority of Khalsa Brotherhood. So, under the thick
            cover of night, Guru Ji left the haveli with three of his disciples.
            The remaining two were assigned the duty of defending the haveli.
            Even when Guru Ji was forced to retreat he blew the bugle and
            announced thrice and then other Sikhs kept on repeating the same
            words: "Peerae Hind may ravad." Meaning: The sage of India has
            escaped.

          <h3>23 December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            The three Sikhs accompanying Guru Ji could not keep pace with Guru
            Ji and in the darkness got separated from him. Guru Ji fatigued,
            barefooted, with his clothes in tatters trudged along the thorny
            wilds of Machhiwara and arrived in a garden. For days he found
            neither food nor shelter. His feet were blistered and bleeding. He
            slept in the woods with an earthen pot as his pillow and open sky as
            his quilt in the winter nights. But his spirit was undaunted,
            neither his noble resolve nor his patriotic fervor ever flickered.
            The super resolve of his spirit is enshrined in his own words as his
            poetic composition which he sang there. His words refer to the
            futilities of life of luxuries, if the remembrance of God is
            missing. The story of his wandering is not just a romance of hair
            breath escapes, but also celebration of great valor, firm and noble
            resolve not to surrender, and full faith in the Creator. After three
            days the three separated Sikhs rejoined the master. The saga of
            history continued to be created by Guru Ji, as he moved to Hehar, on
            to Jatpura, and then on to Raikot. It is at Raikot Guru Ji learnt
            about the fate of his mother and two younger sons.

          <p>
            On 23 December the two younger Sahibzadas aged nine and seven years
            were produced in the court of Nawab Wazir Khan of Sirhind. There,
            they were enticed to change their faith with promises of positions
            in kingdom and marriages into the royalty. When the persuasions and
            temptations failed to produce the desired results the ruler resorted
            to threats, torture including deprivation of food and sleep. For
            four cold winter nights they were forced to spend in an airy tower
            to weaken their spirits and resolve.

          <h3>27 December 1704</h3>
          <p>
            On 27 December a council of ministers were called upon to consider
            ways and means to bring the princes into the fold of Islam. The
            princes were brought to the court and an inevitable choice of death
            or acceptance of Islam was offered to them. The princes, true to
            their faith, preferred death over conversion. At that time, Diwan
            Sucha Nand rose from his chair and walked closer to two princes and
            asked them if they were released what will they do? Their reply was
            that we will go to jungles and raise army of Sikhs, procure horses,
            arms so that we can fight the oppression. The reply infuriated Diwan
            Sucha Nand and he counseled the Nawab; "Sir, this progeny of a cobra
            had better be smothered in time." A very cruel form of execution was
            devised. The Sahibzadas were bricked alive, and when they fainted
            out of suffocation, they were beheaded. The grandmother Mata Gujari
            expired in the prison on hearing about the tragic end of her two
            beloved little grandsons. This tragic event took place on 27
            December 1704.

        <h3>Few Days from then</h3>
          <p>
            It was at Raikot that Guru Ji heard about the entire episode from
            the messenger Mahi, who was deputed to Sirhind to get first hand
            information. Even after learning about the brave deaths of his
            remaining two younger sons, Guru Ji spirit was still high and his
            statement; "What if I have lost four sons, but countless more
            alive." is a testimonial to his ever high spirits. Guru Ji declared
            they have not died, but have become immortal. They have lifted the
            downtrodden and shown the way to liberty. Guru Ji declared that the
            rule of Mughals has been uprooted. The colorful history continued to
            be created..
