          <p>If we look back into the past, in the time of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, we can see that a very significant history has been created and all his life is so full of significant events that it is difficult to pick some. However, if we look closely
            at the month of December, in 1704 AD we will find that a plethora of significant events took place; these were not just significant historical events related to Gurus and the Sikhs, but these were events that turned the course of history.
            Lets look at these events in brief.</p>

            <h3>The birth of the Khalsa, Baisakhi 1699</h3>

            <p>In the early part of 1699 Guru Gobind Singh Ji sent out messages to his followers to make a special effort to attend the Baisakhi festival. So thousands gathered at Anandpur Sahib. After the morning service Guru Ji appeared before them on
              specially erected platfrom. Suddenly he stopped staring at the crowd, he pulled his sword out and raised it high with his right hand. There were a million voices and then a sudden hush. Now, like a thunder, the Guru spoke, "My dear Sikhs,
              I am glad to see so many of you here today. Today I have planned to offer you something special. but for this I need your help. Indeed, I need your head. I need the head of a Sikh who claims his faith in me. If anyone among you claims to
              be a true Sikh, then come forward and prove it." Before he had finished his last sentence, a tall lean Sikh was already moving forward towards the Guru on the platform. His name waas Daya Ram and he was from Lahore. Reaching the Guru, he
              folded his hands, bent his head forward and said, "O, Lord, the true Guru, I claim to be your humble Sikh. My head is ready for you. Please take it." Hurriedly, the Guru held him by the arm and led him into the tent. Soon after the crowd
              inside heard the sound of a sword striking a body. They then heard a voice, Waheguru and then a loud thud. Then they saw the Guru coming out of the tent, looking even more fierce. Fresh blood dripped down his sword. The crowd was truly horrified.
              Nobody needed to be told what had happened inside the tent. Once again the Guru stood on the platform. The same demand was repeated and four more times Sikhs stepped up and offered their lives to Guru Ji.</p>
            <p>Then the Guru appeared. He was followed by five sikhs who gave their heads. All were dressed in saffron colour, with blue scarved tied round their waists and turbans. They looked very much like the Guru himself. All stood on the platform facing
              the crowd. Their faces beamed with joy and satisfaction. the Guru spoke to the crowd, "My dear Sikhs; we all remember that when Guru Nanak gave a test to his Sikhs only one passed it. Now two hundred years after the first test, I have given
              you another final test. However this test was not for Guruship, but for the 'nationhood'. I call it the Khalsa, the brotherhood of the pure at heart. You have witnessed the birth of the Khalsa. These Sikhs standing beside me are my Panj
              Piaray (five beloved ones). Each of them is a saint and a soldier in one. These five Sikhs are dedicated and daring enough to lead; and strong enough to support the edifice of the Khalsa." Later the Guru introduced his Sikhs to a new kind
              of initiation ceremony called the Amrit (Baptism). First he Baptised the 'Panj Piaray' and gave them a new name - 'Singh'. Then he himself was baptised by 'the five' and called himself Gobind Singh instead of Gobind Rai. He considered the
              entire Khalsa as his sons and daughters , not only his four biological sons. So does he say, For the Khalsa (my children), I have sacrificed my 4 (biological sons). So what if four are dead? Thousands of my sons will live hereafter! Guru
              ji considered the Khalsa as his own image, and said that he himself is present within the Khalsa.</p>
